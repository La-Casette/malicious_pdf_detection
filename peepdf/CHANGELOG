    * Fixes:

		- Fixed bug when encrypting/decrypting hexadecimal objects (Thanks to Timo Hirvonen for the feedback)
		- Fixed silly bug related to abbreviated PDF Filters
		- Fixed bug related to the GNU readline function not handling correctly colorized prompts
		- Fixed log_output function, it was storing the previous command output instead of the current one
		- Fixed bug in PDFStream to show the stream content when the stream dictionary is empty (Thanks to Nahuel Riva)
		- Fixed Issue 12, related to bad JS code parsing due to HTML entities in the XFA form (Thanks to robomotic)
		- Fixed Issue 10 related to bad error handling in the PDFFile.decrypt() method
		- Fixed Issue 9, related to an uncaught exception when PyV8 is not installed
		- Fixed bug in do_metadata() when objects contain /Metadata but they are not really Metadata objects

	* Others
	
		- Removed the old redirection method using the "set" command, it is useless now with the shell-like redirection (>, >>, $>, $>>)

	* Known issues
	
		- It exists a problem related to the readline module in Mac OS X (it uses editline instead of GNU readline), not handling correctly colorized prompts.
